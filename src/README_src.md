poet_reduced.py file is meant to work with MuonAnalyzer.cc whereas poet_realdata.py works with MuonAnalyzer_realdata.cc. poet_reduced.py and MuonAnalyzer.cc
are configured to obtain gen level information. poet_realdata.py and MuonAnalyzer_realdata.cc are essentially the original configuration and analyzer used in the final
